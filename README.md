The repo present DDI-LLM, a hybrid pipeline that integrates open-source Large Language Models (MedGemma) with molecular graph representations to predict Drug–Drug Interactions (DDIs) for previously unseen compounds. The approach fuses SMILES-based structural embeddings with literature-derived semantic embeddings, enabling the model to leverage both molecular and textual information for DDI prediction. A cross-attention interaction module is used to combine these two types of embeddings effectively. Evaluation on DrugBank v5.1.10 and PubChem BioAssay demonstrates improved generalization and higher performance (in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC) compared to baseline models such as DeepDDI, MolTrans, and BioBERT-DDI. Additionally, we evaluate the Cold-Start Precision, showing that DDI-LLM performs well on unseen drug pairs, which is a critical aspect of real-world drug safety assessments. This work significantly contributes to the advancement of DDI prediction and has important clinical implications for drug safety and therapy optimization.
